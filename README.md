# ECM_NLU

## Traditional Seq2Seq
* This model is taken from torch chatbot tutorial. Run jupyter `Baseline/chatbot_tutorial.ipynb` 

## Emotional Chatting Machine (ECM): Seq2Seq + Emotional Embedding + Internal memory + External memory (PyTorch Implementation)

* Open jupyter notebook `Baseline/jupyter/dialogue_preprocessing_ECM.ipynb`, get the dialogue data from google drive.

## Official Implementation of ECM (TensorFlow)

* Open directory `ecm/`, follow the readme, to run training on the dataset `daily dialogue`, change emotion category size to 7.
